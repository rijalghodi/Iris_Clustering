## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an optimal model for clustering iris flowers species using the Iris dataset. Additionally, we aim to build a multiclass classification model to classify unseen iris flowers based on the insights gained from the clustering analysis.

## Dataset

You can download the dataset from the following link: [Iris Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j3qxOQxnjVk-wZuRE92J7sRhXeqj_piO/view?usp=sharing)

Columns in datasets are:
- `sepal length (cm)`
- `sepal width (cm)`
- `petal width (cm)`
- `petal width (cm)`
- `species`

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to extract valuable insights.
- Feature Engineering: Transform and refine the features to improve model performance.
- Clustering Model Building: Identify the appropriate clustering algorithm and determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Build a multiclass classification model by leveraging the insights from the clustering model.
